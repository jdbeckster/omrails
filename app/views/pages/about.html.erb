	          <p>Find something awesome to do, or have an awesome idea but no time to do it right now? Add that idea to a custom, private or public, 'bucketlist' of your choice. Like a playlist, but more fun.</p>

	          <h4>Collaborate</h4>
	          <p>You have some friends that you would do some things with, and other friends that you would do other things with. Share the right types of lists with the right types of people, Do things together, Enjoy life more. </p>

	          <h4>Be Interesting</h4>
	          <p>Nobody really cares about your facebook pictures. It is what you do that makes you an interesting person. Prove to us that you are interesting by creating, sharing, and marking Hupelahs complete. This could be quite fun to look back on in a few years.</p>
